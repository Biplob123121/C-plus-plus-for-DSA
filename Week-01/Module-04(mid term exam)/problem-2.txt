a. How does class and object work? How to declare an object? 5+5

Class: Class is a group of objects. It is declared outside the main function and we need to use the class keword to declare a class. Here a class is given bellow:
class Student{
    public:
        char name[100];
        int roll;
};

Object: Object is the unit of a class. It has some behaviours or values. We can use these values. Here an object is given bellow:
inside the main function and using the above class we can declare an object:
Student s1;
char nm[100] = "Biplob Kumar";
strcpy(s1.name, nm);
s1.roll = 20;


b. What is a constructor and why do we need this? How to create a constructor show with an example. 10+5

Constructor: Constructor is one kind of function which has no return type and it is declared inside the class. We can use a constructor to input the value of an object easily. Here an example is given bellow:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    public:
    char name[100];
    int roll;
    Student(char* nm, int rl){
        strcpy(name, nm);
        roll = rl;
    }
};
int main()
{
    Student s1("Biplob", 20);
    return 0;
}
in this example, here Student() is an constructor. 

c. Create a class named Person where the class will have properties name(string), height(float) and age(int). Make a constructor and create a dynamic object of that class and finally pass proper values using the constructor.  15

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Person
{
public:
    char name[100];
    float height;
    int age;
    Person(char *nm, float ht, int ag)
    {
        strcpy(name, nm);
        height = ht;
        age = ag;
    }
};

int main()
{
    char name[100] = "Biplob Kumar";
    Person *p1 = new Person(name, 6.50, 28);
    return 0;
}
